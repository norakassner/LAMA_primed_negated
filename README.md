# Negated and Misprimed Probes for Pretrained Language Models

LAMA (LAnguage Model Analysis) is a probe for analyzing facutal knowledge caputred by pretrained language models, see the

This repository extends the original LAMA probe by negated and misprimed probes. The negated probes are integrated into Facebook's original repository the misrpimed data can be downloaded here.

## 1. Download Scripts

    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/LAMA.git

```conda create -n lama37 -y python=3.7 && conda activate lama37
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Download the models

~55 GB on disk

Install spacy model
```bash
python3 -m spacy download en
```

Download the models
```bash
chmod +x download_models.sh
./download_models.sh
```

The script will create and populate a _pre-trained_language_models_ folder.
If you are interested in a particular model please edit the script.

## 3. Negated LAMA

Download the data via Facebook:
```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/LAMA/negated_data.tar.gz
tar -xzvf negated_data.tar.gz
rm negated_data.tar.gz
```
Set the set the flag `use_negated_probes` in `scripts/run_experiments.py`.

## 4. Misprimed Data

Download the data from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/norakassner/LAMA_primed_negated.git
```
